## Update

1) Full dataset (Initial, intermediate and final optimized AIGs) is hosted at [OpenABC-D](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=ae7b03ad-9e50-472c-9601-ff99054ae47c&origin_path=%2F). All relevant bench, graphml, label CSVs and run logs are stored here. The entire zip is 1.4TB so it has been equally divided into 14 chunks, each of 107GB. For downloading and unzipping, minimum of 3TB disk space is required.

2) ML-ready dataset (Pytorch files for initial AIG and synthesis recipe information + target labels as pickled file ~ 19GB) is hosted [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6399454#.YkTglzwpA5k). All one need is to configure the paths as documented and run the models for QoR prediction.

3) Pytorch-geometric has newly released versions 2.0.* and is not backward compatible. Thus, to use the already existing pytorch data, please install [Pytorch-geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric/tags) version < 2.0.* or regenerate the pt data files using the dumped graphml files.

4) Original AIGs of designs have been added in the repository under **bench_openabcd**.
 

## Overview

**OpenABC-D** is a large-scale labeled dataset generated by synthesizing open source hardware IPs using state-of-art logic synthesis tool **yosys-abc**. We consider 29 open-source hardware IP designs collected from various sources (MIT-CEP, IWLS, OpenROAD, OpenPiton etc) and synthesized them with 1500 random synthesis flows (we call them *synthesis recipes*).


Each synthesis flow has a predefined length **L** (L=20, in our case). We preserved all AIGs: starting, intermediate and final AIGs with labels like number of nodes, longest path, sequence of atomic synthesis transofrmations (*rewrite*, *refactor*, *balance* etc.) along with graph statistics, area and delay of final AIG. 

We converted the AIGs in **pytorch** data format that can be directly used by a machine learning engineer lessening the effort of costly labeled data generation and pre-processing. **OpenABC-D** can be used for a variety of learning tasks on logic synthesis such as

1. Predicting quality of result (QoR) performance of a *synthesis recipe* on a hardware IP. 
2. Area and delay prediction post techonolgy mapping.
3. Learn functional and structural features of AIG using self-supervised labels (useful for tasks like RL-based logic synthesis)

Our dataset can easily be used for graph-based machine learning framework like [Pytorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric). The data generation pipeline of **OpenABC-D** is shown as follows:

## Installing dependencies

We recommend using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment to install pre-requisites packages for running our framework and models.
We list down the packages which we used on our side for experimentations. We recommend installing the packages using *requirements.txt* file provided in our repository.

- cudatoolkit = 10.1
- numpy >= 1.20.1
- pandas >= 1.2.2
- pickleshare >= 0.7.5
- python >=3.9
- pytorch = 1.8.1
- scikit-learn = 0.24.1
- torch-geometric=1.7.0
- tqdm >= 4.56
- seaborn >= 0.11.1
- networkx >= 2.5
- joblib >= 1.1.0

Here are few resources to install the packages (if not using *requirements.txt*)

- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
- [Torch-geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)
- [Networkx](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html)

Make sure that that the cudatoolkit version in the gpu matches with the pytorch-geometric's (and dependencies) CUDA version.

UPDATE: The code in this forked repository has been tested to work on newer and latest versions of pytorch/pyG libraries. This requires some manual configuration and more importantly conversion of the saved
pt files into a format recognizable by newer PyG library. Here is our pip freeze list (limited to relevant entries for this project). We strongly recommend using MiniForge to create a virtual enviornment. Also, this configuration works fully on Mac M1 Pro ARM architecture and GCP Cloud VM CUDA enabled systems.

```models``` directory contains the benchmarked model described in details in our paper. The names of the python utilities are self explainatory.

#### Case 1: Prediction QoR of a synthesis recipe

We recommend creating a following folder hierarchy before training/evaluating a model using our dataset and model codes:

	├── OPENABC-D
	│   ├── lp1
	│   │   ├── test_data_set1.csv
	│   │   ├── test_data_set2.csv
	│   │   ├── test_data_set3.csv
	│   │   ├── train_data_set1.csv
	│   │   ├── train_data_set2.csv
	│   │   └── train_data_set3.csv
	│   ├── lp2
	│   │   ├── test_data_set1.csv
	│   │   └── train_data_set1.csv
	│   ├── processed
	│   ├── synthesisStatistics.pickle
	│   └── synthID2Vec.pickle


```OPENABC-D``` is the top level directory containing the dataset, train-test split files, and labeled data available. Transfer all the relevant zipped pytorch data in the subdirectory ```processed```.

The user can now go the ```models``` directory and run codes for training and evaluation. An example run for **dataset split strategy 1** (Train on first 1000 synthesis recipe, predict QoR of next 500 recipe)

```
python train.py --datadir $HOME/OPENABC-D --rundir $HOMEDIR/NETV1_set1 --dataset set1 --lp 1 --lr 0.001 --epochs 60 --batch-size 32

```

Setting ```lp=1``` and ```dataset=set1``` will pick appropriate train-test split strategy dataset for QoR regression problem. The model will run for 60 epochs and report the training, validation and test performance on the dataset outputing appropriate plots.

Similarly for **split-strategy 2** and **3**, one can set the dataset as ```set2``` and ```set3``` respectively.

For evaluating performance of specific model on a custom curated dataset, a user can create appropriate csv file with dataset instances and add it to dictionary entry in ```train.py```. For evaluating existing dataset split, one can run the following code.

```
python evaluate.py --datadir $HOME/OPENABC-D --rundir $HOMEDIR/NETV1_set1 --dataset set1 --lp 1 --model "gcn-epoch20-loss-0.813.pt" --batch-size 32

``` 

The test-MSE performance we obtained on our side are as follows:

|   Net Type |     Case-I     |   Case-II     |   Case-III   |
|    :---:   |     :---:      |    :---:      |    :---:     |
|    NetV1   |   0.648+-0.05  |  10.59+-2.78  |  0.588+-0.04 |
|    NetV2   |   0.815+-0.02  |  1.236+-0.15  |  0.538+-0.01 | 
|    NetV3   |   0.579+-0.02  |  1.470+-0.14  |  0.536+-0.03 |
